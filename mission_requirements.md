# SUAS requirements
## Performance requirements
- fly 3 miles with full load
- Waypoint error should be configurable, max 50ft
- stay within mission boudaries
- stay above 50 ft AGL when more than 200ft away
## Notes
- Trees can be up to 140 ft tall, this is to be considered when setting points above trees.
- drone should be between 50ft AGL to 400ft AGL at all times.

- GCS:
   - presents a maps showing flight boundaries, UAS position.
   - All other competition elements.
   - Indicate the UAS speed in KIAS or ground speed in knots
   - Indicate the altitude above MSL in feet.
- Must perform waypoint lap before attempting other tasks
   - Team may decide the order of all other tasks after the lap
- 15 mins Setup Time:
   - Before mission Will receive the waypoints and other mission details by paper printout
   - Given in UTM decimal degree and altitude in feet AGL and MSL
   - last 5 mins pre-mission we must give a pre-mission brief (what we're gonna do in which order).
   - brief must include identification of the GCS operator and safety pilot
- 30 min Mission Time:
   - mission timer start as soon as the above 15 mins are done
   - Timer keeps going until the UAS has landed and the UAS has cleared the runway AND the team relinquishes the airspace.
   - Can get a 10 min timeout, which will stop the mission time for 10 mins. Requesting this timeout will result in a penalty.
- 10 min tear down time:
   - Team is provided with 10 mins to remove all equipement from the flight line tent area.

- Autonomous flight
   - takeoff and landing may be done autonomously or manually, more points for autonomous flight
   -
